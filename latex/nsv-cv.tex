\section*{Summary}
I am an IT professional, largely by trade, with working experience in the setup and maintenance of {\bf scalable}, {\bf resilient} architectures. I have a strong suit for collaboration and efficiency, while being highly organized and responsible in my work. I possess professional experience in {\bf cloud} infrastructures, {\bf distributed systems} and {\bf continuous integration} and delivery. Non-professionally, I have dabbled with backend development, game development and information security.
\medbreak
I am currently seeking a new position related to {\bf\color{MonokaiProMagenta} systems architecture, reliability, and operations} (so called SRE, DevOps), or {\bf systems programming}.

\section*{Achievements}
My team and I implemented the first Mesosphere DC/OS Enterprise cluster in Argentina, around 2016. I became the non-official consultant for cloud architectures, Docker and systems monitoring in the company.\\
I co-organized (and gave a talk in) the first DC/OS \href{https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/mesos-dcos-argentina/events/234352452/}{meetup} in the region. We had official support from Mesosphere on the organization of such meetup.\\
I also gave a talk in \href{https://www.blackhat.com/eu-16/presenters/Nicolas-Villanueva.html}{Blackhat Arsenal Europe 2016} and co-organized a local meetup focused on APIs in general: \href{https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/preview/APIsAR/events/243084908}{APIsARVI}.
Involved in initiatives focused on gender diversity in engineering, I was a mentor in two Chicas en Tecnología events.

\section*{Hobbies and personal interests}
As mentioned before, my technical skills were mostly learned by hobby. I have a fairly prolific Github account (https://github.com/nicovillanueva) with several of my personal projects, ranging from deployment and cluster managements tools, to a collaborative platform for p5.js sketches (in progress).

As I have a knack for information security, I also developed a proof-of-concept ransomware and a reverse-shell for gaining access to nodes in distributed clusters.
Other relevant interests include: {\bf privacy} and online rights of individuals, {\bf machine learning}, image and {\bf signal processing}, and {\bf digital art}.
