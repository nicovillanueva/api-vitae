                    - Linux-based systems administration;
                    - Container technologies such as Docker;
                    - Distributed architectures such as Mesosphere DC/OS, or simply Apache Mesos;
                    - Backend development in Go (“golang”), Python and Java;
                    - Obsessive about well-designed, secure architectures, microservices or otherwise;
                    - Scripting, specially in Python and Bash, but with non-negligible exposure to Ruby, JavaScript, Perl, and others.

                    An Information Technology professional largely by trade, strongly focused on scalability, resilience and well-defined
                    development workflows. Highly organized and responsible, with a strong suit for efficiency and collaboration within
                    teams, organizations and the software community in general.
                    I possess experience in infrastructure automation and design, distributed systems, backend development and more.
                    Currently seeking a new position related to systems architecture, reliability, and operations (so called SRE, DevOps,
                    Systems Administration).
