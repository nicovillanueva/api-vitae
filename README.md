# API-Vitae

My CV in API REST form. It uses Echo, Cobra, Viper and whatever looks flashy and interesting.

You can checkout the usage by cURLing the root: `GET /`. A very loose homage to HATEOAS principles. Routes relevant to my CV itself can be found in the `routing.go` file.

You can also download my full CV in .pdf form by requesting `GET /v1/download`
