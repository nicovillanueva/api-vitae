  I am an IT professional, largely by trade, with working experience in the setup and maintenance of scalable, resilient architectures. I have a strong suit for collaboration and efficiency, while being highly organized and responsible in my work. I possess professional experience in cloud infrastructures, distributed systems and continuous integration and delivery. Non-professionally, I have dabbled with backend development, game development and information security.
  I am currently seeking a new position related to systems architecture, reliability, and operations (so called SRE, DevOps), or systems programming.

hobbies: >-
    As mentioned before, my technical skills were mostly learned by hobby. I have a somewhat prolific Github profile (https://github.com/nicovillanueva) with several of my personal projects, ranging from deployment and cluster managements tools, to a collaborative platform for p5.js sketches (in progress).
    As I have a knack for information security, I also developed a proof-of-concept ransomware and a reverse-shell for gaining access to nodes in distributed clusters.
    Other relevant interests include: Privacy and online rights of individuals, machine learning, image and signal processing, and digital art.
